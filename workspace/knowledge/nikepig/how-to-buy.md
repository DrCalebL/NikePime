## Important Notes

- **Always verify the policy ID** before swapping
- **Start small** — test with a small amount first
- **Check liquidity** — large swaps may have high slippage
- **Keep some ADA** — you need ~2-5 ADA minimum in wallet for transactions

## Getting ADA

If you need ADA first:
- **Centralized exchanges:** Coinbase, Kraken, Binance
- **On-ramps:** MoonPay, Simplex (in-wallet options)
- **P2P:** LocalBitcoins (for ADA)

## Scam Warning

- Only use official links
- Never share your seed phrase
- If someone DMs you "support," it's a scam
- If the policy ID doesn't match, it's a fake token
