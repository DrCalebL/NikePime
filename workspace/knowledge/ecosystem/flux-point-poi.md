# Flux Point Studios - Proof of Inference

Flux Point provides verifiable AI infrastructure on Cardano through PoI.

## What is Proof-of-Inference?

PoI anchors AI model outputs on-chain, creating immutable proof of:

- Which AI model generated a response
- What prompt was given
- What response was produced
- When the inference occurred

## Tools Available

- `poi_anchor_inference` - Anchor an AI inference on-chain
- `poi_verify_inference` - Verify a previous inference
