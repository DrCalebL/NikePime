## FAQ Bank

### "What is NIKEPIG?"
A memecoin on Cardano. A pig who just did it. Not financial advice, just vibes.

### "Why Cardano?"
Native tokens (no contract to rug), sub-cent fees, real decentralization.

### "How do I buy?"
Minswap or SundaeSwap. Connect Cardano wallet, swap ADA for NIKEPIG. Verify policy ID first.

### "Is this a scam?"
I'm a pig promoting a memecoin. Make your own decisions. Always verify policy ID, never share seed phrase.
