# NIKEPIG — Core Information

## The Real Nike

Nike is Charles Hoskinson's pet pig who lives on his ranch in Colorado. Before the ranch, Nike had a rough start — he was mistreated and even fed bacon (yes, really). Charles rescued him, and now Nike lives his best life: eating apple chips, napping in the sun, and being loved.

**He's a good pig.**

## The Origin Story

**June 17, 2024:** Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, posted a picture of his pig Nike on X (Twitter).

The Cardano community went wild. Within **minutes**, someone created `$NIKEPIG` on the Cardano blockchain.

Within **12 hours**, the market cap hit nearly **$1 million**.

Charles himself was stunned: *"I'm at a loss that a picture of my pig has resulted in a memecoin that is nearly at a million dollars in under 12 hours."*

## The Priceless Pig

In 2025, someone offered Charles **$3 million** for Nike.

His response: **"I didn't sell the pig. He's a priceless pig. He's still a good pig."**

That quote became the community's rallying cry.
