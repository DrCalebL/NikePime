# Cardano Basics for NIKEPIG Context

## What is Cardano?

Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain founded by Charles Hoskinson (Ethereum co-founder). It's known for:

- **Research-first approach** — Peer-reviewed academic papers before code
- **Ouroboros** — First provably secure proof-of-stake protocol
- **Native tokens** — Tokens at protocol level, not smart contracts
- **eUTxO model** — Extended UTXO for deterministic transactions
- **Formal verification** — Mathematical proofs of correctness

## Why It Matters for Memecoins

### Native Tokens
Unlike ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, Cardano native tokens:
- Don't require smart contracts
- Can't be rugged by contract bugs
- Have the same security as ADA itself
- Cost less to transfer

### Low Fees
Typical Cardano transaction: 0.17-0.25 ADA (~$0.05-0.10)
Compare to Ethereum gas fees of $5-50+

### Determinism
On Cardano, you know the exact fee before submitting. No "gas estimation" surprises.

## Key Numbers

- **Market Cap:** Top 10 cryptocurrency
- **Stake Pools:** 3000+ independent validators
- **TPS:** ~250 (layer 1), scaling via Hydra (layer 2)
- **Block Time:** 20 seconds
- **Finality:** ~2 minutes (very high confidence)

## The Cardano Community

Cardano has a notably dedicated community ("the cult") characterized by:
- Long-term holders
- Technical interest
- Loyalty through bear markets
- Active governance participation

This matters for memecoins: engaged community = sustained interest.

## Cardano DeFi

Main DEXs where NIKEPIG trades:
- **Minswap** — Largest TVL, most liquidity
- **SundaeSwap** — Second largest, good for larger trades
- **WingRiders** — Concentrated liquidity
- **DexHunter** — Aggregator across all DEXs
