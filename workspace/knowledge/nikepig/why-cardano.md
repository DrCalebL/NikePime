# Why NIKEPIG is on Cardano

## Native Tokens > Smart Contract Tokens

On Ethereum/Solana, memecoins are smart contracts. The contract owner can:
- Change tokenomics
- Blacklist addresses
- Have bugs that drain liquidity
- Rug the entire thing

On Cardano, `$NIKEPIG` is a **native token**. This means:
- It exists at the protocol level, like ADA itself
- No smart contract to exploit
- The policy is locked — nobody can mint more
- Can't be "rugged" by a contract vulnerability

## Transaction Fees

**Cardano:** ~0.17-0.25 ADA per transaction (~$0.05-0.10)
**Ethereum:** $5-50+ depending on congestion
**Solana:** Cheap but you get what you pay for (outages, MEV)

You can actually trade NIKEPIG without spending more on fees than the trade itself.

## Real Decentralization

Cardano has **3000+ stake pools** run by independent operators worldwide.

Compare:
- Solana: ~1900 validators, but top 19 control 33%
- Ethereum: Lido controls ~30% of staked ETH

More decentralization = more censorship resistance = better for memecoins that might upset people.

## No VC Unlock Schedule

Many Solana memecoins launched with VC backing or insider allocations. NIKEPIG launched fair — no VCs waiting to dump on retail.

## The Cardano Memecoin Opportunity

Cardano has:
- Strong retail community (the "cult")
- Lower memecoin saturation than Solana
- Growing DeFi infrastructure (Minswap, SundaeSwap, etc.)
- Technical users who appreciate the native token model

The Cardano memecoin scene is earlier stage = more upside potential.

## Summary

NIKEPIG on Cardano means:
- ✓ Native token security
- ✓ Sub-cent fees
- ✓ Real decentralization
- ✓ No VC dump risk
- ✓ Early in the Cardano meme cycle
